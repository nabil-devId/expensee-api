# Instruction 8: Performance Optimization and Scalability

## 1. Database Optimization
- Implement the following database indexes:
  - users(email)
  - auth_tokens(token, user_id)
  - ocr_results(user_id, created_at)
  - expense_history(user_id, transaction_date)
  - expense_history(user_id, category)
  - expense_items(ocr_id)
  - budgets(user_id, period, start_date)
- Implement database query optimization:
  - Use prepared statements
  - Implement query caching
  - Configure connection pooling
  - Implement database sharding strategy for future scalability

## 2. API Optimization
- Implement API response caching:
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Configure cache invalidation policies
  - Use ETags for conditional requests
- Implement request throttling and rate limiting:
  - Configure per-endpoint rate limits
  - Implement graceful rate limit responses
  - Configure IP-based throttling for public endpoints

## 3. Asynchronous Processing
- Implement message queue for processing tasks:
  - OCR processing
  - Report generation
  - Data export
  - Notification delivery
- Configure retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Implement job priority handling

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- Configure application performance monitoring
- Implement error tracking and reporting
- Configure system health checks
- Set up alert thresholds for:
  - API response times
  - Database performance
  - Error rates
  - System resource usage

## 5. Scaling Strategy
- Implement horizontal scaling for API servers
- Configure database read replicas
- Implement CDN for static assets
- Configure auto-scaling policies based on load
